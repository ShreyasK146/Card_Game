WHAT'S USED/DONE IN THIS PROJECT:

○ Setup instructions
I tested/debug game session using unity editor + apk built for phone
Launch the game and click on quickmatch. First person will have to wait for second person(who also has to start/quickmatch) to join to start the game

○ Networking solution used
Used Photon Pun to execute networking instructions

○ Explanation of reveal sequence and initiative logic
Played cards are placed as it is in player area and in opponent side its placed as folded and cost and power of cards shown as "?"
Once both players end their turn or when the timer runs out... all cards are revealed(I tried making 1 by 1 but couldn't , same goes for intitative part :( )
Once the cards are revealed all their abilities are executed and scores are updated
Goes to next turn in 4 seconds
